ARGweaver used python 2.7 and is installed in its own conda envirionment: argweaver

Note that you need to chagne the option in the workflow from --resume to --overwrite if you want to redo the analysis

If resampling is aborted the stats file in each sampling dir may be corrupt. Delete the last sample (here 2000):

    find steps/argweaver/samples -name '*2000.smc.gz' -exec rm {} \;

and roll back the stats file to the correct iteration (here 1900):

    find steps/argweaver/samples -name '*[01].stats' | python scripts roll_back_argweaver_stats_files.py 1900
